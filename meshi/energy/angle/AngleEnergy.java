/**
 * Angle  energy term. 
 * Has the general form <b> E = SIGMAi(Ki(Ti-D0i)^2)</b>
 * where <b>Ti</b> 
 * is the angle between three consecutive atoms, <b> D0i </b> 
 * is their expected average angle (depends on their types) and <b>Ki</b>
 * is a force constant that again, depends on the atom types.<br>
 * This class is used for both calculating the angle-energy term of an energy function 
 * and for updating the forces on each atom accordingly.<b>
 * It is assumed that the list of angles is constant during the simulation. <b>
 * The numerical method was addapted from Ron Elber's Moil.
 *
 *Important Note: This energy term has a non-continous point at angle values of 0 or Pi.
 *In order to circumvent these discontinuites we modified the regular parabolic form of this 
 *term near the problematic values. At about ~10 degrees (the exact value is hard coded in class
 *AngleEnergyElement) from both 0 and PI the energy starts to climb very steeply so that energetic
 *values of infinity are set to the discontinuous points. We thus hope the simulation could never 
 *reach them. On very rare starting condition, however, these problems might never the less be 
 *encountered.
